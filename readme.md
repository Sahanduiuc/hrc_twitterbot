## iHillaBot

Have you ever wanted to know what it is like to work for Hillary Clinton? Or have a chat with her? Or wondered what was actually in those emails that were released by the State Department? 

Look no further because I've built a TwitterBot that randomly tweets from Hillary Clinton's [FOIA release emails](https://foia.state.gov/search/results.aspx) in response to @mentions. Check out the code and the TwitterBot, [iHillaBot](https://twitter.com/iHillaBot/with_replies).
